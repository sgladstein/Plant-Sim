# Status

Read this first at the start of every session (CLAUDE.md).

## Milestone
M0: headless core. Backlog: docs/design-plan.md §7; one GitHub issue per WP (#1 = WP0 ... #13 = WP12).

| WP | Issue | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 Repo scaffold | #1 | done (PR #14) |
| 1 Units and RNG | #2 | done (PR #14) |
| 2 Weather and sun | #3 | done (PR #14) |
| 3 Organ graph | #4 | done (PR #14) |
| 4 Species schema | #5 | done (PR #15) |
| 5 Soil and water | #6 | done (PR #16) |
| 6 Light | #7 | done (this PR); owner accepted 95% of leaves within 10% for M0, re-check in WP12 (decision 0008) |
| 7 Physiology | #8 | next |
| 8 Herb architecture and roots | #9 | not started |
| 9 World | #10 | not started |
| 10 Export and CLI | #11 | not started |
| 11 Validation harness | #12 | not started |
| 12 Tuning and lock | #13 | not started |

## Last validation report
None yet (WP11).

## Open questions for the owner
- Set `main` as the repository's default branch in GitHub settings (the agent cannot change repo settings).
- WP13 (Bevy smoke test on the GTX 1070) should run around sessions 3 or 4 of M0.

## Review follow-ups (fold into a later PR)
- WP4 review: cross-field validation in `Species::validate` (t_base < t_opt < t_max, emergence < flowering < maturity, growth temperature ordering, finite tropisms, `#rrggbb` colors); a typed trait view of `Phenotype` before WP7/WP8; the discrete-trait rounding rule in the species model card; `specific_stem_length` likely 10–20 cm/g (WP12).
- WP5 review (/mnt/project-files/reviews/wp5-review.md): derive the lateral fraction from a diffusivity (4e-5 m² h⁻¹ gives 0.1 at 2 cm) so 5 cm cells are right; per-column surface radiation so canopy shade dries only sunlit columns; `M2PerHour` and `M3` newtypes for `take_up` and `cell_volume`; interpolate the soil temperature lag; add "infiltration can fill a lower cell through a saturated one in the same hour" to known limits.

## Notes for the next session
- WP12: regenerate the light ray tracer fixture from a sim-exported 60-day plant and re-run `single_plant_matches_ray_tracer`; tighten its bounds if every leaf passes (decision 0008).
- Local checks: see CLAUDE.md "Session start".
- `cargo nextest` runs in CI; locally `cargo test --workspace` is equivalent.
